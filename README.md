# cpp-logistic-planning
A C++ logistics route simulation project developed for the ISE105 course at Sakarya University. The program dynamically generates a 10x10 cost grid, assigns random delivery points, and simulates a courier navigating optimal paths while logging delivery costs and visited nodes.
